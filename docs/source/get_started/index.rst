Creating Applications
=====================

This section is intended to help implementers of MOTECH get started creating custom solutions. The topics below cover some of the common features that need to be configured for a MOTECH app.

As the platform matures, most of the features below will be usable by implementers without developing any software code. As of now, a number of these features do require some coding in order to use (the topics below provide sample code where appropriate).
